"""
Theory Module - Theoretical Framework Implementations
Mathematical foundations and theoretical validations for St. Stella's genomic analysis.

This module contains implementations and validations of the theoretical frameworks
underlying the New Testament genomic analysis system.

Theoretical Frameworks:
- S-Entropy Navigation Theory
- Cardinal Direction Coordinate Transformation Theory  
- Dual-Strand Geometric Analysis Theory
- Complexity Reduction Proofs
- Cross-Domain Pattern Transfer Theory

Future implementations will include:
- Mathematical proofs of complexity reduction
- Theoretical validation algorithms
- Cross-domain pattern transfer mechanisms
- S-entropy navigation mathematical foundations
