The amplitude envelope demonstrates how high-frequency oscillations modulate on slower timescales, creating natural separation of scales with frequency ratios $\omega _1/\omega _2 \sim \omega _2/\omega _3 \sim 10^3$ producing hierarchical structure across many orders of magnitude. \textbf {(B)} Resonance enhancement of coupling strength maximized when mode frequencies match ($\omega _1 = \omega _2$). The blue curve shows coupling strength versus frequency ratio $\omega _1/\omega _2$, with sharp peak at resonance (red dashed line) where mode overlap integral maximizes, producing strong interaction; off-resonance coupling decreases rapidly, creating natural hierarchy based on frequency matching. \textbf {(C)} Force range and strength determined by mediator properties for electromagnetic (blue, $1/r$), strong (red, Yukawa), and gravity (purple, $1/r$) interactions. Log-scale plot shows potential strength versus distance: EM and gravity have infinite range ($1/r$ falloff), while strong force has finite range ($\sim 10^{-15}$ m) due to massive mediator producing exponential Yukawa suppression $V(r) \propto e^{-m_{\text {med}}r}/r$. \textbf {(D)} Force hierarchy spanning 40 orders of magnitude from strong ($\alpha _s \sim 1$, normalized to $10^{40}$) to electromagnetic ($\alpha _{EM} \sim 10^{-2}$, giving $10^{38}$) to weak ($\alpha _W \sim 10^{-6}$, giving $10^{34}$) to gravity ($\alpha _G \sim 10^{-39}$, giving $10^1$). Bar chart shows logarithmic coupling strengths with colors matching force types, demonstrating that fundamental forces span extraordinary range of interaction strengths. \textbf {(E)} Explanation of hierarchy: coupling strength $\alpha \propto \omega _{\text {mediator}}^2$ depends on mediator frequency squared and mode overlap integral. High-frequency mediators (strong, EM) produce strong local coupling, while low-frequency mediators (weak, gravity) produce weak global coupling; hierarchy is necessary consequence of timescale separation, not accidental fine-tuning requiring explanation. \textbf {(F)} Unified hierarchy showing all forces at characteristic length scales: Planck scale ($10^{-35}$ m, dark blue), strong force ($10^{-15}$ m, purple), electromagnetic force ($10^{-10}$ m, pink), weak force ($10^{-18}$ m, orange), and gravity (infinite range, yellow). Same underlying physics of oscillatory mode coupling operates at different scales, with apparent diversity arising from scale-dependent mediator properties rather than fundamentally different interaction types}{figure.caption.26}{}}
