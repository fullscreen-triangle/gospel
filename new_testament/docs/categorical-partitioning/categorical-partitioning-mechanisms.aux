The blue curve shows a typical trajectory in a two-dimensional phase space projection, with the initial point (red circle) and return point (green square) illustrating the recurrence property. \textbf  {(B)} Quantum wavefunction oscillation: the spatial structure of a quantum state $\psi (x,t)$ (blue curve) and its probability density $|\psi (x,t)|^2$ (red shaded region) at a fixed time. The wavefunction is a superposition of modes with different frequencies $\omega _i$, leading to spatial oscillations. The probability density oscillates in both space and time, reflecting the wave nature of quantum mechanics. \textbf  {(C)} Molecular vibrational modes at temperature $T > 0$: discrete energy levels $E_n = \hbar \omega (n + 1/2)$ for a quantum harmonic oscillator. Each mode can occupy states labeled by quantum number $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots  $, with energy spacing $\hbar \omega $. The diagram shows a diatomic molecule oscillating between compressed and extended configurations, with the energy levels indicated on the right. At finite temperature, multiple levels are thermally accessible. \textbf  {(D)} Vibrational configuration transitions: a system with $M = 3$ modes (three independent oscillators) and $n = 2$ states per mode (e.g., ground and first excited state). The five boxes show different configurations labeled by quantum number triples $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$. The total number of distinguishable configurations is $W = n^M = 2^3 = 8$, giving entropy $S = k_{\mathrm  {B}}M \ln n = k_{\mathrm  {B}}\cdot 3 \ln 2 \approx 2.88 k_{\mathrm  {B}}$. The red star indicates a transition between configurations. \textbf  {(E)} Oscillation persists at all $T > 0$: vibrational energy (vertical axis) as a function of temperature (horizontal axis) for a quantum harmonic oscillator. The green curve shows the average energy $\langle E \rangle = \hbar \omega / 2 + \hbar \omega / (e^{\hbar \omega / k_{\mathrm  {B}}T} - 1)$, which approaches the zero-point energy $E_0 = \hbar \omega / 2$ (dashed line) as $T \to 0$ but never reaches zero. The cosmic microwave background temperature (2.7 K) is marked, demonstrating that even at the coldest naturally occurring temperature in the universe, oscillatory motion persists. This illustrates that oscillation is fundamental and never ceases. \textbf  {(F)} Third law barrier prevents $T = 0$: polar plot showing the accessibility of different temperature states. The green region represents temperatures $T > 0$, which are physically accessible. The red central region represents the state $T = 0$ (absolute zero), which is unreachable due to the third law of thermodynamics. The barrier arises because the zero-point energy $E_0 = \hbar \omega / 2$ prevents complete cessation of oscillation—removing the last quantum of energy would require infinite time. The angular coordinate has no physical meaning; the plot simply visualizes the topological structure of the accessible state space (a disk with the center removed).

Demonstrates that arbitrarily precise measurement is thermodynamically forbidden. \textbf {(C)} Partition-free traversal: top yellow bar shows partition-free (light) with $S=0$, $T=0$ (zero entropy, zero time). Annotation: "Partition-free: whole interval as single category." Bottom blue line with red dots shows partitioned traversal with $S>0$, $T>0$. Annotation: "Partitioned: creates $n-1$ boundaries → entropy → time." \textbf {(D)} Proper time from partition entropy: proper time $\tau $ (vertical) versus number of partitions $n$ (horizontal). Color gradient from purple (low $n$) to yellow (high $n$). Yellow line at bottom shows partition-free with $\tau =0$. Linear growth: $\tau \propto n$. Formula: $\Delta \tau = S_{\text {partition}} / (\kB \omega )$. At $n=50$, proper time $\tau \approx 25$. \textbf {(E)} Maximum speed from zero partition: speed $v/c$ (vertical) versus partition density $\rho $ (horizontal). Blue shaded region shows allowed range. At $\rho =0$ (partition-free), speed $v=c$ (maximum, yellow star). As $\rho $ increases, speed decreases: $v<c$. Annotation: "Mass → localization → partition → entropy → time → $v<c$." Dashed line shows $c$ (partition-free). \textbf {(F)} Mass requires partition: flow diagram showing causal chains. Top path (Mass $m>0$): Mass → Localization → Partition → Entropy $S>0$ → Time $\tau >0$ → Speed $v<c$. Bottom path (Massless $m=0$): No localization needed → No partition required → $S=0$, $\tau =0$, $v=c$. Annotation: "Massless: $m=0$ → No localization needed → No partition required → $S=0$, $\tau =0$, $v=c$."}{figure.9}{}}
