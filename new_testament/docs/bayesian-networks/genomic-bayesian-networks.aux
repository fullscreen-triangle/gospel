High-density regions (red) indicate frequently visited coordinate space. (\textbf {E}) Sequence length distribution (mean: 5,116 bp) showing log-normal pattern typical of genomic sequences. (\textbf {F}) GC content distribution (mean: 0.473) with color-coded bars indicating AT-rich (red), balanced (green), and GC-rich (blue) sequences. (\textbf {G}) Coordinate correlation matrix revealing strong independence between X, Y, Z dimensions (r≈0), validating orthogonality of cardinal directions. Magnitude shows expected correlation with coordinates. (\textbf {H}) Magnitude versus angle scatter plot colored by Z-coordinate, demonstrating three-dimensional structure of sequence trajectories. Stratified patterns indicate sequence-specific geometric signatures. (\textbf {I}) Geometric statistics summary: 10,000 total coordinates from 9 sequences, coordinate ranges [-1.00, 1.00] for X and Y, [0.00, 34.00] for Z, mean magnitude 17.07±9.75, demonstrating successful transformation of symbolic sequence data into quantifiable geometric space}{figure.caption.9}{}}

String palindrome detection achieved 100\% success (all sequences), geometric palindrome detection reached 0\% (no sequences met strict geometric symmetry criteria), while multi-dimensional combined approach achieved 100\% success by integrating both symbolic and geometric information. This demonstrates complementarity of analysis methods. (\textbf  {B}) Palindrome length distribution showing extreme concentration at short lengths: 60,000+ palindromes at 3-4 bp (mean: 4.4 bp), with exponential decay for longer palindromes. The distribution matches Figure 3A, confirming reproducibility across analysis pipelines. (\textbf  {C}) Most common palindromic patterns ranked by frequency: AAA and TTT (homopolymers) are most abundant (~3,500 each), followed by AGA, TCT, GAG, TGT (dinucleotide repeats), and CTC, GGG (trinucleotide repeats). The prevalence of simple repeats reflects mutational slippage and replication errors as dominant sources of palindromic sequences. (\textbf  {D}) Palindromes per sequence distribution showing high variance (mean: 191.0 palindromes/sequence, range: 0-800+). The right-skewed distribution indicates some sequences are palindrome-rich (>400 palindromes), likely corresponding to repetitive DNA regions, while others contain few palindromes, suggesting unique coding sequences. The 100\% multi-dimensional success rate validates that combining string-based detection (for exact matches) with geometric analysis (for structural context) provides comprehensive palindrome characterization. Geometric methods excel at detecting approximate palindromes and structural symmetries that string methods miss, while string methods provide precise sequence-level identification. This synergy exemplifies the power of dual-representation analysis.}}{29}{figure.caption.10}\protected@file@percent }
